# Literature

Literature is a way and means to express the objective world and subjective knowledge by using language or words as media. When words are no longer only used to record, but are endowed with other thoughts and feelings, and have the beauty of art, it can be called language art. Poetry, prose, novels, plays, fables, fairy tales and other different genres are important forms of literature. Literature in different forms, namely genre, expresses inner feelings and represents social life in a certain period and a certain region. Literature is one of the subject categories of humanities, which is on the top of social structure together with philosophy, religion, law and politics.
